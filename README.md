Plan:
- Plot basic variables
- Split the data in train_train and train_test
- Give simple NN the inputs
- Give it a quantative score
- Then build complexity

Long term thoughts:
- Are we biased by one or two very long journeys.

Next step:
- Build in a simple NN predictor. Build in a scoring system

 - Understand score, what does it mean, is the one I want
 - See if we can some how vary training tools (nNeruond ect...)
